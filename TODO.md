- [ ] README for baselines
- [ ] Polish visualizations
- [ ] Global project README
- [ ] NLP equations, physics used and car modeling in /docs
- [ ] Multi lap MPC
- [ ] Instead of assuming velocity changes linearly between steps (Trapezoidal), we model the state trajectory within each segment as a 3rd-degree polynomial -> NLP using 3rd-Order Gauss-Legendre Collocation
- [ ] GUI for visualizing results -> able to select tracks, cars, parameters, etc. (maybe slightly change the trajectory? Very technical though)
